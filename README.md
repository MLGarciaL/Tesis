# Tesis

This Git repository contains all the data and processes related to my final work for my bachelor's degree. The research focuses on innovation and institutional quality, primarily from the perspective of evolutionary economics. All rights are reserved by Universidad Católica de Cuyo.

The image titled "Mapa Marco Teórico" represents the initial conceptual framework of this research project, outlining the theories that could support the investigation. Meanwhile, the image "Metodología" contains the first literature review conducted for this study.

At present, the project is awaiting evaluation by the final tribunal and is available only in Spanish. Once approved, I will translate it as soon as possible. The final document (*Documento Final*, which contains the complete investigation in PDF format) will be uploaded upon approval; however, it can be requested via email at garciallujan@gmail.com.
